# Optimal-Threshold-Distributions
I compare the relative capacities of response threshold distributions across agents to divide labor and complete work 

normal distributions performed the best. it had the highest kurtosis levels, it successfully predicted the relationship between N and DOL, and it had a realistic DOL range. It also performed well compared to GA 

ultimately ga algorithm does not produce performance better than other algorithms
biologically, this means that typical distributions may be sufficient for accomplishing colony goals
for multi agent systems, this means that finkiky and computationally expensive optimization methods may not be necessary to organize swarms. This model took a lot of manual tuning, and on average took 6 times longer to find an optimal solution than it did for the biological distributions.
